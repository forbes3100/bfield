# BField TODO

190613: Update field_server_eqns.odt sections 6 and 7 (Update Coefficients,
         Step), in the same manner as section 5 (InitPMLarea).

190614: Fix (or at least warn) case where Fields object size or location is
         off-grid, which causes Probe.Vol int-size errors, impedance errors.

190615: Have resistor blocks automatically calculate their conductivity given
         a resistance. Maybe automate cap blocks too.

230126: Fix Blender ignoring letter commands such as "X" while running sim.

230126: Fix "CustomData_blend_write error: layer '':15 - can't be written to
         file" upon file save.

230127: Add scene-to-python export and import, for scene source control.

230127: Have Cmd-K delete all Arrow objects? Or ask to delete upon save.

230127: Make sure when starting a sim that no others are still running. When
         so, have to type an ESC to kill each one.

230127: Change status message when stopping and cleaning too.

230129: Get bfieldshowmodal.py working on Linux: missing PIL module.

230129: Set up Meep output comparison on Linux.
