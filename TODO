# BField TODO

190613: Update field_server_eqns.odt sections 6 and 7 (Update Coefficients,
         Step), in the same manner as section 5 (InitPMLarea).

190614: Fix (or at least warn) case where Fields object size or location is
         off-grid, which causes Probe.Vol int-size errors, impedance errors.

190615: Have resistor blocks automatically calculate their conductivity given
         a resistance. Maybe automate cap blocks too.

230126: Fix "CustomData_blend_write error: layer '':15 - can't be written to
         file" upon file save.

230127: Add scene-to-python export and import, for scene source control.

230129: Set up Meep output comparison on Linux.

230130: bfield.py: use a common mesh for volume probe arrows.

230130: bfield.py: is getMaterialsAndDims transparency working?

230201: bfield.py: fix abspath("//") for import siunits.

230203: bfield.py: make onScreenInit work from "Run FDTD" button too.

230203: bfield.py: Track down why opkey-P doesn't work on Linux.

230203: Track down random "No C.space_data" with dynProbe, and random 0 values.

230204: Fix plane probe image rotation in some cases.

230204: Finish R and C block types: should insure unique material.

230205: server: fix crash in stopSim() if 0Fields object changed?

230205: bfield.py: insure that plane probe images are unique.

230205: PML appears to be out of whack.
